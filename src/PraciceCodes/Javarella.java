. Enter 20 numbers from the keyboard, save them in a list, and then sort them to three other lists:
Numbers divisible by 3 (x%3==0), numbers divisible by 2 (x%2==0), and all other numbers.
Numbers simultaneously divisible by 3 and 2 (for example 6) go into both lists.
The order in which the lists are declared is very important.
2. The printList method should display each list item on a new line.
3. Using the printList method, display these three lists. First, the list for x%3, then the list for x%2, and then the last list.
Requirements:

    •
    Declare and immediately initialize 4 ArrayList<Integer> variables. The first list will be the main one. The other lists will be supplementary.
    •
    Read 20 numbers from the keyboard and add them to the main list.
    •
    Add to the first supplementary list all numbers in the main list that are divisible by 3.
    •
    Add to the second supplementary list all numbers in the main list that are divisible by 2.
